*** To compile your program, press the Build button

*** To run all the test cases, press the Run button

If you want to just run one of the test cases, make sure your program is compiles, then in the Terminal window at the bottom of the screen, type

runcase

If you do that, the program will list all of the test case names.

Pick one of those names and type

runcase CASENAME

where CASENAME is one of the test case names.

If you want to see how runcase will run your program for a particular case without actually running
the case, type:

runcase -v CASENAME



The files are in the directory $LIB/p1. You can see the list of files by saying "ls $LIB/p1".
Files suffixed .correct are the "correct" output for a particular case.

If you want to run your program directly against a given file, you can type

prog1 $LIB/p1/peg

you can use the UNIX cat command to see the contents of any of the files in $LIB/p1

saying

cat $LIB/p1/charl

will give you the contents of that file

All of the files are also zipped up in an archive called testfiles.zip. If you like, you can download this file
to your own machine and use the various test files to test your program

*** To submit your program (which runs all the test cases first) press the Submit button
